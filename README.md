I'm looking for a job as a android developer and that was my first test-job project.
Unfortunately 5 hours wasn't enough for me so I screwed it up a little bit.
Well, I guess I did because I didn't get a reply. I wasn't good enough.
  
  Anyway now I'm able to do something 3 times better in the same time.
  It was a good exercise. I guess I will fix and update it later.
